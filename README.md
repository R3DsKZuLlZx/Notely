# Welcome to Notely!

Notely is a note taking app that I'm creating to learn Angular 😁

## Set up the app

1. Open a console in `Notely.Web` and run `dotnet ef database update` 
2. Open a console in `Notely.WebUI` and run `npm install` 

## Run the app
1. Run the `Notely.Web.https` run configuration
2. Open a console in `Notely.WebUI` and run `ng serve`
3. Got to `http:localhost:4200` to view the app
